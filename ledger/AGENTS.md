# Folder Overview

Ledger utilities for transaction records.
- `master_ledger.py` manages a full history of trades for auditing.

Trade data is ingested from the `execution/` layer and summarised by
`analytics/` tools. Recent updates added DuckDB snapshots so ledger histories
survive restarts when Postgres is unavailable.

- **Reminder:** triple-check modifications and run tests to prevent regressions.

Before approving this commit, exhaustively inspect the codebase end-to-end. For every file changed, added, or renamed, (1) summarise its purpose and key classes/functions, (2) trace upstream callers that rely on it and downstream modules it invokes, and (3) list every folder or module that will therefore need corresponding updates (tests, configs, docs, CI scripts, API stubs, etc.). While traversing, flag any file that has become unreachable, duplicated, or superseded and recommend explicit deletion; the final state must contain no obsolete artefacts. Provide a total count and explicit paths of all impacted modules/folders. If at any point a dependency graph edge is ambiguous, a migration step is unclear, or removal of a legacy file is debatable, pause and ask for clarification rather than guessing.
